# Server Rendered React Application

## Overview
This simple application serves a server-rendered React application to the client. The application is made up of only a single component, but has full interactivity.

## Usage
To preview the app, first install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install`

Then, build the client code and start the server with one step using

`npm start`

The application should now be visible at `http:localhost:7777`.
